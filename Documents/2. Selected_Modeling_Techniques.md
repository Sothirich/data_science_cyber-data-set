# [✅] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This is a supervised learning algorithm that can perform binary or multiclass classification by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes. SVM can handle high-dimensional and nonlinear data, and can be robust to noise and outliers. However, SVM can also be computationally expensive and sensitive to the choice of kernel and regularization parameters.**

# [✅] Random Forest Classifier
This is an ensemble learning algorithm that can perform binary or multiclass classification by combining multiple decision trees and using majority voting or averaging to make predictions. Random forest can handle large and complex data, and can reduce overfitting and variance by introducing randomness and diversity. However, random forest can also be prone to bias and underfitting if the trees are too shallow or the number of trees is too small.

# [✅] Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network
This is a supervised learning algorithm that can perform binary or multiclass classification by using multiple layers of artificial neurons that learn nonlinear mappings between inputs and outputs. Neural networks can capture complex patterns and interactions in the data, and can be flexible and adaptable to different tasks. However, neural networks can also be difficult to train and tune, and may suffer from overfitting, underfitting, or vanishing or exploding gradients.

# [✅] XGBoost
XGBoost, short for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a popular and powerful machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks. It is based on the gradient boosting framework and has gained widespread adoption in various data science and machine learning competitions due to its speed and performance.
